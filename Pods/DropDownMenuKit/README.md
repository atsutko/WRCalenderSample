DropDownMenuKit is a custom UIKit control to show a menu attached to the navigation bar or toolbar. The menu appears with a sliding animation and can be deeply customized. For example, with icons, embedded controls, or a checkmark to denote a selected row among multiple menu cells.

The control is made up of three parts: 

- DropDownMenu: the menu itself, a UIView subclass that contains a UITableView presenting one or more DropDownMenuCell(s)
- DropDownMenuCell: a menu entry, implemented as a UITableViewCell subclass
- DropDownMenuTitleView: an optional title view to toggle the menu, which is usually put in the navigation bar and acts as a disclosure indicator
